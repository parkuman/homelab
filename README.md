# HomeLab

This repository contains all of the code and documentation for my homelab.

I started this project in January, 2025. It currently runs on a used Acer Chromebox CXI4 I picked up off of Facebook Marketplace.

## Goals

- use this as a way to learn about dev ops, self-hosting, networking
- observability via Grafana
- everything is managed via Gitops
- self host apps I use every day
- my website
- [AnyType](https://anytype.io/) - for note taking
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) - media streaming
- PiHole or similar

## Tooling

- OS - Debian
- k3s
